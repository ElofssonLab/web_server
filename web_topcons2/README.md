## Web-server for TOPCONS2

## Description:
This is the web-server implementation of the TOPCONS2 workflow.
The web-server is developed with Django 1.6.4

TOPCONS2 is an updated version of the widely used TOPCONS for predicting
membrane protein topologies using consensus prediction.
It is faster yet more accurate than the old TOPCONS according to our solid
benchmarking. Moreover, it predicts not only the trans-membrane helices,
but also the location of signal peptide

TOPCONS2 may be used for the purpose of academic research only.

TOPCONS2 is available at http://topcons.net
